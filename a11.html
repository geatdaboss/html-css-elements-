    <h1>Let it snow</h1>
    <h2>Micheal Buble</h2>
    <p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful <br>
But the fire is so delightful <br>
And since we've no place to go <br>
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! <br>
<br>
It doesn't show signs of stopping <br>
And I've brought some corn for popping <br>
The lights are turned way down low <br>
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! <br>
<br>
When we finally kiss goodnight <br>
How I'll hate going out in the storm! <br>
But if you'll really hold me tight <br>
All the way home I'll be warm <br>
<br>
<em>The fire is slowly dying <br>
And, my dear, we're still goodbying <br>
As long as you love me so <br>
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!</em> <br>
<br>
Oh! It doesn't show signs of stopping <br>
And I've brought some corn for popping <br>
And the lights are turned way down low <br>
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow! <br>
